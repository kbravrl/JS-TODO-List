# JS-TODO-List

This is a simple TODO List application that allows users to add and remove items from a list. The items are stored locally in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Item:** Users can add items to the TODO list using the input field and the "Add Item" button.
- **Delete Item:** Each item in the list has a delete button that allows users to remove the item.
- **Persistent Storage:** The list of items is saved in the browser's local storage, so the list persists across page reloads.
